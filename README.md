# Video On Demand Manager (SvelteKit)

*This repo is a Proof Of Concept*

In order to better understand and to study this awesome javascript framework, this project is just a proof of concept.
This means it deals with most of the main concepts which form the base of SvelteKit.

### In general this application allows you to: ###
Manage videos on a per user basis.
Create time frames limiting access to booked video content.
Create and send tokens (sign-in link) to simplify the login process using build-in Email Manager and a basic Mail-Template creation tool.
